## Git Strategy 
Our git master will be Matthijs for this project.
<!-- ...(see edit)
For this project we will be using a feature branch workflow. 
This mean we will be creating a new branch for each major feature we will be working on,
committing to that branch our changes and then if everything is finished creating a pull request which will be checked by atleast one other team member before pushed.
After a release has been made tests will be run on github, and if those complete successfully it will deploy automatically to the server -->
