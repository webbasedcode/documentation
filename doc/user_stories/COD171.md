## Beschrijving 
As a programmer I want to have a fast response service to be able to work together with other programmers, which means that the redis for a file should be closed after a while. In this its prefered to include a file autosaver so that unsaved progress wont be lost due to the closed redis.

 ## Steps
1. Programmer opens a project
2. Programmer opens a file
3. System will search for opened file in database
    3.1. System returns error if file not found
    3.2. System sets an epoch time for when file is opened
Optional 4: Programmer writes in file
    4.1. System will update epoch to latest update time
5. (Timer: 10 minutes) System will check each file for last change epoch with current epoch
    5.1. System sends files that havent been updated in the past 12 minutes to close.
    5.2. System sends files that have been updated in the last 12 minutes to save.
6. System saves files
7. System closes files
8. System logs how many files have been closed, saved and have had errors in console.

> * Any time, the connection with redis is lost
> 	  1. System will show this in the logged error
> 	  2. System will continue and retry in 10 minutes

> Precondition: Logged in, authorized, within project.
> 1. Programmer selects terminal
> 2. Programmer enters text
> 3. Programmer sends run command
> 4. System checks text for illegal statements
>     1. System returns error for found illegal statements
>     2. System skips execute  
> 5. System executes text
> 6. Programmer receives result
> 	  1. Feedback from Linux terminal
> 	  2. Error for illegal statements
> 	  3. Error for runtime exception
> 
> * Any time, the connection with back-end is lost:
> 	  1. System display error message
> 	  2. System try to reload connection -->
