## Beschrijving 
As a request, the website can not be used whilst not being approved by an already approved user, to limit its userbase and make the website a bit more secure. This means that a new user should be able to log in, but not capable of doing anything until another user, which is already approved, accepts this new user. Which then adds the user role to the new user, so that they can use the website. On top of that adds the approver to the new user, so that in case of a wrong user being added. It can be discovered what happend. So in short: Domain user: username, join date, role, approver
