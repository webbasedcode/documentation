## Info
* Colaborator: [Vincent](https://github.com/webbasedcode/documentation/blob/main/doc/members/Vincent.md) 
* [link to jira of User Story](https://codelaborative.atlassian.net/browse/COD-52)


## Beschrijving 
Reworking our running code to also work with java, this should first build the .jar and add to a container and then run it. 
The only difference with the javascript will be the dockerfile so the steps and diagrams will be exactly the same 


## Steps
see [COD32](https://github.com/webbasedcode/documentation/blob/main/doc/user_stories/COD32.md) for steps
