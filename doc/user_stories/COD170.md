## Beschrijving 
At the current moment its necessary to press save to save the project. As if you leave the website now, without pressing save, the project will not be saved.
This will be solved by adding a automatic scheduled function that saves the code every 10 minutes, if a file hasn't been interacted with for 12 minutes it's closed. 


## Steps
> precondtion: User is logged in, User is allowed in a project, User is in the page of the allowed project
> 1. Programmer makes a change in the project
> 2. System Saves Project
> 3. System reloads project page
