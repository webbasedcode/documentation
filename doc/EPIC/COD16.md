## Info
* [link to EPIC in jira](https://codelaborative.atlassian.net/browse/COD-16)


## Beschrijving 
> As a programmer I want to be able to code in a shared in-browser coding-project
> So that I can work together with coworkers on a problem.
> This would mean an open document where other programmers can type, and we all see the updates happening live.
> This should be seperated into projects and files, so that only the programmers active in that file will see the updates happening.
<!-- {beschrijving van {TYPE}}
> voorbeeld: As a programmer i want to be able to delete a file on the frontend.
> This should send a request with the projectId and {file Identifyer} to the backend after which the backend should look for the project with this id, 
> grab the latest version of the project out of the cache and delete the file if the project contains the {file Identifyer}. 
> Then an (succes) response shoud be returned -->
