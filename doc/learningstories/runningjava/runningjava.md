# Learning story: 

### Details:
- Name: Learning how to use different types of code languages with docker containers
- Date: 24-06-2022
- Researcher: Vincent
- Reason: We need to be able to run other code languages then javascript
- Functionality: Being able to run java

## Why Java instead of other solutions
- Java is used as one of the most used languages
    - Our project also uses java
## Conclusion on why:
We'll implement java into our application because it should be relatively easy and deliver alot of functionality

## Options for implementation:
- Using OpenJDK docker container
- Using Amazon JDK container
- Using other jdk containers?

## Conclusion on implementation:
- we decided to use amazon's coretto container because the default jdk container has some logging on startup that interferes with us being able to get the run output from logs 

## Best place to learn:
